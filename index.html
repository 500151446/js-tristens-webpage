    <h1>A Short Biography</h1>
    <p>Just your average nerd to be honest. I'm into video games and anime. I'm trying to work towards my goal of developing games without putting all my eggs in one basket.
    I figured that the software development program would give me what I needed to pursue game development while still giving me something very marketable to fall back on. 
    I think I'll likely continue studying computer science at the university after this but I suppose it depends on what happens after I finish the associate's.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I have a cat named Milo. He's an big orange maine coon mix with a lot of attitude. He's often sweet but he's far more often salty. He likes to bite my toes.</p>
    <p>I also love to cook and play a few instruments, most often guitar. It's another dream of mine that I don't expect to go anywhere. I'm far too shy to sing, but I do hope to write my own music if I ever do make a game someday.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I don't read anymore and I don't care much for movies, so here's a short list of animes I'd recommend, I guess.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hellsing Ultimate</li>
        <li>Dungeon Meshi</li>
        <li>The Ossan Newbie Adventurer</li>
        <li>Chainsaw Man</li>
        <li>Mushoku Tensei</li>
    </ul>
